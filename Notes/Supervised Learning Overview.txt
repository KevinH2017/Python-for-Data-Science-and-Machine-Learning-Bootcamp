Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is an algorithm that is trained using labeled examples, such as an input where the desired output is known.
For example, a segment of text could could have a category label, such as:
    - Spam vs Legitimate Email
    - Positve vs Negative Movie Review

This works by creating a network that receives a set of inputs along with the corresponding correct outputs, and the algorithm
learns by comparing its actual output with correct outputs to find errors. Afterwards, it modifies the model accordingly.

Supervised learning is commonly used in applications where historical data is used to predict likely future events.

Machine Learning Process:
Starts with Data Acquisition, then to Data Cleaning, the data is broken into Training and Test sets.
The Training set is used in Model Training & Building to be trained and validated against the Test set, 
it loops until it achieves a satisfactory level of accuracy in Model Testing. The last step is Model Deployment, 
where the model is deployed to production.

Data Acquisition:
    Collecting relevant data from various sources, such as customers, sensors, etc.

Data Cleaning:
    Clean and format the data using Pandas

Split data into Training and Test sets:
    - Model Training & Building - Uses the training data to train the model
    - Test Data - Used to evaluate the performance and accuracy of the model

Model Testing:
    - Test the model against the test data, and make changes to the model parameters as needed to improve its accuracy
    to Model Training & Building

Model Deployment:
    Deploy the model to production for real-world use.

Data is often split into 3 sets:
    - Training Data:
        Used to train the model parameters
    - Validation Data:
        Used to determine what model hyperparameters to adjust
    - Test Data:
        Used to get some final performance metrics on the model
