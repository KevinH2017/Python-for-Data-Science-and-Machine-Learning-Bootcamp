Multi-Class Activation Functions

Multi-class activation functions take on a specialized role in helping models determine the probability that of a given
input beloging to a specific class. The easiest way to organize multiple classes is to have one output node per class.

There are 2 main types of multi-class situations:
    - Non-Exclusive Classes
        A data point can have multiple classes/categories assigned to it.
        EX: Photos can have multiple tags like beach, family, vacation, etc.
    - Mutually Exclusive Classes
        Only one class per data point.
        EX: Photos can be categorized as being grayscale or full color but not both at the same time.

To organize multiple classes, you must organize categories for the output layer.
