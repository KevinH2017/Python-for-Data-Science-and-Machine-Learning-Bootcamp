Regression Error

Regression is when a model attempts to predict continuous values.

Three most common evaluation metrics for regression:

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
    - The mean of the absolute value of errors.
    - It is measured as the average absolute difference between the predicted and actual values.
    - Used to measure how accurately a regression model is.
    - However it will not punish large errors.

- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
    - The mean of the squared errors.
    - Larger errors are noted more than MAE.
    - Measures the average squared difference between predicted values and the actual values in the dataset.
    - 
    
- Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
    - The square root of the mean of the squared errors.
    - It is mainly used in regression analysis and forecasting, where accuracy matters significantly.
    - The lower the RMSE, the better the model's prediction accuracy.

Compare the error metrics to the average value of the label in the dataset to try to get an intuition of its
overall performance. Context is important, as the scales of the errors and the average value of the label can
vary widely.

Regression metrics help the predictive model to evaluate its performance, helping to make better decisions about
overall performance evaluation.
